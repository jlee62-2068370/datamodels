# MongoDB
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is an opensource noSQL database. It utilizes an object orientated data model and is cloud-hosted (AWS, Azure, etc.). To access mongodb using Java, a user must first construct a 'MongoClient' class. After, the user must use a Connection URL to establish a connection to a MongoDB database.
